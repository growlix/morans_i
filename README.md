# morans_i
MATLAB functions for computing two measures of spatial correlation: Moran's I, a measure of spatial autocorrelation, and the Mantel test, a correlation between physical distance and feature distance

mL_moransI_master_acrossScales is the highest level function for computing Moran's I. mL_mantel_test is for computing a Mantel test.

sanePColor.m, ciplot.m, and distributionPlot are from the MATLAB file exchange, modified by me.
